Description: Retrieves live data from the OR Extended database (via the 
  dbprocess package) and analyzes the data. Provides functions for both 
  analysis of the students (estimated using only the operational items), test
  items (both operational and field test) and tests. Note that all operational
  items are anchored to their previously estimated values (on the vertical 
  scale) during analysis. This ensures that all newly estimated values (persons
  and field test items) are relative to the established vertical scale. 
  Functions to produce and plot the test information function and test 
  characteristic curves are also provided.
